MEAN Messages
===

We're going to create a basic MEAN stack project that will act as a message board. And by "we" I mean (ahem... MEAN) all of us. I'm going to enter what I call "puppet mode" and only will write what the class decides I should in order to complete the project.

- First, we'll briefly come up with a plan for how the project should behave.

- Next, we'll review the code already in place.

- Then we'll start working together to create the project.

- Finally, we'll all log in to the final project on my localhost and have a few minutes where we are nto allowed to talk and can ony chat via the message board.
